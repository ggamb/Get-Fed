## Description
Get Fed is an Uber Eats clone where users can find restaurants near them, search through menus, and add items to their carts. Users can create accounts, log in, and sign out. If a user is logged in, they can use the checkout function to buy their products.

Get Fed leverages the publicly available [Documenu API](https://documenu.com/) to find restaurants near you, provide information about restaurants including name, cuisine, phone number, website, hours of operation, and price range ($-$$$$). Clicking on a restaurant will show the restaurant's menu also provided by Documenu.

Features to be implemented:

*Full Stripe API functionality to add credit card information

*Search bar to find restaurants and menus in other locations

*Order history page so users can see previously purchased items


## Installation
Use [this](https://get-fed-project.herokuapp.com/) link. If the deployed application shows no data, the Documenu API key may have run out :(

Alternatively, if you would like to use this code, feel free to clone the code, open it in your favorite IDE, run `npm i` in the root and client and server folders, and then `npm develop` from the root of the project. To create additional API keys, simply navigate to [this](https://documenu.com/) website, create an account, and use the API key on the dashboard page.

## Usage
Click the link above and you will be directed to Get Fed, which will look something like this:
